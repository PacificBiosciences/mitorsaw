<p align="center">A tool for mitochondrial analysis for HiFi sequencing data</p>

***

Mitorsaw identifies and quantifies mitochondrial variants from [PacBio HiFi](https://www.pacb.com/technology/hifi-sequencing/) datasets.
Key features include:

* Identification of homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants for the full length of the mitochondria
* Detection and removal of NUMT reads from variant calling steps
* Generates a phylogenetic tree-like structure to estimate heteroplasmic variant inheritance and haplotype abundances, creating consensus sequences for each haplotype
* Generates customized IGV visuals for reviewing results
